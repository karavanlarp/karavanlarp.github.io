<h3>The World</h3>
			<p>Once upon time there was a world, average of size and adequate for living. Most of it was covered by the Great Sea, that separated two places.</p>
			<p>Those places were called Theuma and Alentum.</p>
			<p>The people of Theuma were named Theumites, and for thousands of years they reigned alone. They were powerful and they could do anything. There were many of them with many magics - water, air, fire, earth, shadow and light. They lived in magnificent castles and whiled their days away searching for the limits of their powers. </p>
			<p>On the other side of the sea lay the Empire of Alentum. The Alenti were not as powerful as the Theumites, but they were brave and many. Their life was good and they prospered. It was not to last. The land itself began to die and the mountains spat fire, leaving the Alenti with the choice to leave or to die. They built many great ships and sailed over the sea to Theuma.</p>
			<p>The Theumites allowed the ships to land, but did not treat their guests as equal. How could they be, with no magic and such short lives? But the Alenti would not accept this, and they conquered the whole of Theuma for themselves. Where they could not fight the magic of the Theumites, they overwhelmed them by sheer numbers. Thus the age of power came to an end. However, this did not mean an end to the discord.</p>
			<p>Having left Alentum together, the Alenti were now divided in opinion.</p>
			<p>Some of them wished to continue the traditions of lost Alentum, but the others wanted to live free of dictates. They did not come to an agreement.</p>
			<p>Thus in the west, the first Emperor of Leonte was crowned. In the east, the remnants swore to accept no one’s rule. They had no rulers, instead they pledged their loyalty to freedom and the land they lived in. If they called themselves by any name, it was People of the Free Lands.</p>
			<p>Even as they began as one people, they grew different over the years. The Empire has not forgotten those it thinks of as its own, but there is a price to being a citizen. The price of obedience to the Emperors and their laws. A good life under someone else’s word. Life in the Free Lands is hard, but always by one’s own choices.</p>
			<p>The Theumites did not disappear completely. They live amongst the newcomers to this day, follow their laws, but they have not forgotten their past. The times when they ruled Theuma and the Alenti were just a whisper behind the sea.</p>
			<p>This new land bears many curses and life after death, walking animals and talking statues. The mages calculate their formulas and the priests pray to the gods. The brave soldiers fight and the crafty masters create.</p>
			<p>After years of war, the Empire and the Free Lands have finally made peace. It has brought new life to the borderlands, where before was only blood and death. Trade flourishes, as does cultural exchange. Those who found their life as a citizen hard have left for the Free Lands, and those who want more order have come to the Empire.</p>
			<p>Where there is trade, there is the Merchants’ Guild. Their caravans move through towns and bigger villages, making them even richer. But their ways are much the same and not so interesting to those who yearn for adventure. The more curious may perhaps find those who offer the excitement they seek, and for a good bargain.</p>

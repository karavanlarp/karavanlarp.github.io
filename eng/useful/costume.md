## Costume information 

Some tips for the costumes and make-up of different races.

### The alenti

A normal alenti’s most distinguishing feature is their clothing. The people of the Empire and the Free Lands have very different styles of dress. These fashions mix in the borderlands.

The alenti generally prefer clothing that covers the body. There is no significant difference in male and female fashion. Marriage makes no impact on clothing style either. Clothing shows occupation and status rather than gender (which the alenti consider less important than the aforementioned traits). 

Out-of-game bright neon hair can be partially covered with a scarf. Wigs can be worn if desired.

Make-up: an alenti doesn’t require much make-up. Skin-colour scales can be drawn or glued on if desired.

### The Empire 

Citizens of the Empire dress in colourful clothes as coloured textiles are relatively cheap. Fabrics with printed patterns are also widely available. Embroidered or beaded fabrics are the prerogative of the rich and the Chosen. People wear different jewelry and charms (usually metals and gems, bone amulets are uncommon).

The only limitation in colour is purple. Only the Chosen may wear purple cloaks with golden fringes and embroidery. Many people like to wear different hats. The most popular topcoats are practical coats. Animal skins are not worn as a whole, but fur lining or feather decorations are signs of wealth.

On duty officials wear neutral clothing and a badge with the Imperial lizard, the symbol of their office and their employee number. This badge gives them official authority.

Priests wear long robes decorated with the symbols of their god. The most important element is their holy sign, the aegis, which is always worn on the chest. The aegis must be at least 15 x 15 cm and bear a clearly recognisable symbol of the god (more on symbols in the religion categories of both factions).

Adventurers and members of caravans usually wear practical clothes suitable for trekking in a forest. Those wishing to stay in the shadows prefer more earthy tones.

Armour: leather and lamellar armour is common in the Empire, but chainmail is no longer rare either.

Weapons: all safe foam weapons are allowed.
Hairstyles are simple and practical. The Empire does not have the custom of tattooing. If a character has tattoos, they were made in the borderlands.

Due to the long war, the art of making prostheses is highly developed in the Empire. Rich people can buy prostheses created by mages that are almost as good as the real limb. The poor must make do with wooden versions.

**In addition** 

All clothes, shoes, hats and jewelry that aren’t too modern will be suitable (try to avoid styles from later than the 19th century). Prefer natural fabrics. Don’t worry about the purple. All colours are okay, even bold yellow, pink, violet, turquoise etc. Try to avoid neon colours and clearly artificial or very sparkly fabrics. Lace, woven cords and beads are all very suitable additions to your costumes.

### The Free Lands 

The Free Lands don’t have as much pigment flowers, so their clothes tend to have more natural tones. Patterns are also less common. The most important quality is practicality. Freelanders like wearing animal skins, fangs and bone jewelry.

Priests dress similarly to their counterparts in the Empire. They also carry a holy symbol on their chest that must be at least 15 x 15 cms in size. 

Armor: both leather and chainmail are widely used.

Weapons: all safe foam weapons are allowed. 

Hairstyles differ wildly. Some prefer to go bald, others to grow their hair long and then shave some part of it. Braids are very popular in combination with beads and other decorations.

Tattoos have an important role in society: every tribe and clan has their own sign. Those are usually tattooed on the arms. Tattoos are also used to mark other important life events (the GMs will bring some paints to draw those).

Prostheses are made mostly of wood. Rich people have access to magically altered wood.

**In addition** 

Viking era and medieval era clothes make a nice costume. This goes also for jewelry and accessories. If the character is well-travelled, they may wear more unusual fabrics and jewelry.

### Subraces 

**The lagars**

The lagars don’t differ much from normal alenti. They tend to have a fairer and smoother complexion. The lagar should have fangs in case they decide to bite someone.

**The moroia** 

A fresh moroia isn’t recognizeable. In some years’ time, however, their face will appear sunken and their skin turns a greyish colour, even despite regular refreshing. The may also have sown together or cobbled together parts, if they haven’t had the opportunity to restore themselves properly.

**The Old Blood**

The most important feature of one of the Old Blood are prominent scales that differ from the skin in colour. Lizard eye lenses can be worn if desired.

**The wulvers** 

The wulver beast form must be clearly visible and recognizable for the other players. It must have either long claws, a different nose, feathers, visible ears, a tail or some other distinguishing feature. If the character is always in beast form, the make-up and other elements can be applied before the game. If the character will go through a transformation in-game, add details that are easy to attach and detach during the game.

### Theumites

The theumite player must be fully covered, with no visible skin.

The face can be hidden by a veil or a mask (or both). The face and eyes can be disguised by heavy make-up, latex and coloured lenses if desired as well. Hands can be covered with gloves or very long sleeves.

The costume colour must clearly show the theumite’s element. Theumites from the Empire and the Free Lands don’t have noticeable differences. Some wear alenti-made accessories, but most prefer metal as it’s not as easily destroyed in a source, compared to wood and bone jewelry.

**Colours** 

Fire: light and dark reds, oranges, yellows, some sparks of violet or blue; metal details are gold, bronze or other warm colours
Water: light and dark blues, violets and blue-green accents; metal details are silver and platinum
Air: light and dark greys, white accents; metal details are silver or in cold tones 
Earth: light and dark greens, brown and black accents; metal details use warm tones
Light: yellows and golds; metal details use warm tones
Shadow: violets and blacks; metal details are white or use cold tones

Theumite armour is made of metal and often decorated with crystals. Lighting can be added to crystals if desired. Theumites generally prefer to wear a breastplate, pauldrons, gloves, bracers and leggings (not all of them at once, but a combination of different elements). Full-body armour is not used.

Feet can be covered by robes or not, as desired.

In-game, “the shell” means that a theumite’s clothes and armour form an energy field containing their elemental body.

In addition: 

Most importantly try to avoid getting heat stroke in your costume. ;) You may eat and drink as you wish. It won’t nourish the theumite in-game, but is considered an interesting experience. There are clearly marked magical potions and small parcels (candy) meant for theumite consumption. If your costume makes eating impossible (a veil may allow it, but a mask might be very uncomfortable), it’s easiest to turn away while eating or go to the out-of-game area.

Stretchy fabrics such as lycra or tulle are very suitable as well.

All forms of footwear are suitable as long as they cover the feet.

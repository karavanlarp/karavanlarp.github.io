## Caravan LARP-series character rules

Version: PRE-VIEW

The GM-team is still designing the rules. The point of the pre-view is to give a short introduction to the full set of rules. The GM-team reserves the right to change details in the finished version. The finished version will be up during August.

We have designed the rules so that many different characters can be created, all with the chance to affect the game and find something to do. Classes are meant to be playable from the first event, but also with growth to spare for future games.

The character can be developed further between events with experience points received from attending the larp and doing things. We also give experience points to cool roleplayers and awesome costumes. 

### Playable races 

* **Alenti** - Most numerous of the races, with no special abilities. Recover easily and have the widest class selection.
* **Theumite** - A rare magical race, all theumites can use spells. More robust, but do not recover so easily. Less classes to select. Need a more complicated costume. 

**Alenti subraces** 

All alenti subraces have their advantages and disadvantages. They usually have better resistances to certain things and can use more special skills but they need certain resources or situations to use those skills.

An alenti character who is not a priest or Old Blood can turn into a lagar, a moroia or a wulver during the larp series as well. 

* Lagar - Harder to kill, different powers which need blood to use. Can create other lagars. Cannot select the priest class. 
* Moroia - Already dead. Hard to kill, hard to repair. Cannot select the priest class. 
* Old Blood - Recovers faster than usual alenti. Has a visibly different appearance. 
* Wulver - Can take the beast form and use different powers, but may lose control and retain the beastform for good. Cannot select the priest class.

**Empire and Free Lands** 

Characters from both countries will have access to special skills in their class tree.  

For example Free Lands warriors can select the Rager special skill which gives them additional powers in combat but exhausts them afterwards.  

### Classes 

The classes available to alenti and theumites are a little different. 

#### Alchemist

A master different potions and drugs. Alchemists may harvest powerful components and create potions with different effects. The alchemist may also discover and create new recipes and study components. A more powerful alchemist may create special potions to alter themselves permanently. Only for alenti. 

In the Empire an alchemist is usually the member of the Alchemist’s Guild or self-taught, in the Free Lands they’re known more as herbalists who have learned from an older tribe member or while working in the Society of Healers. 

#### Expert

An expert of their discipline, they have devoted their lives to a certain field and make good work of their skills. This is a class that can be added to another class to support it, as there are many different skills in this class tree. **Available for both alenti and theumites.** 

An expert may be a doctor from the Empire or a skald from the Free Lands. They may also be a theumite who records interesting events or a smith who repairs shells. 

**Some skills** 

Medicine - From basic first aid to life-saving surgery.
Merchant - Some travelers know how to appraise different items and sell them for a profit. 
Rumors - A clever character has many sources for interesting rumors about the places they visit. 
Smithing - A smith may fix weapons, armors or even theumite shells. 
Use of weapons - Anyone can know how to swing a weapon around. 
Various knowledge - Though a character will start with some levels of knowledge, here one can buy knowledge about other cultures, the creatures and plants of Theuma and many other interesting things. 
Wealth - Either the character has an inheritance, or maybe they are just good at finding odd jobs, with this skill they will have more money at the start. 

#### Mage

A mage uses apeiron to fuel their spells. With spells they can often mimic the skills of other classes, to give themselves a magical shield or to disarm a trap without being harmed. A mage’s life is full of formulae or runes and a lot of patience. Practically all mage spells take a bit of time to cast and therefore the mage is usually better at preparing themselves and others for a battle, instead of actually felling opponents in battle. On the other hand the mage is usually the one to turn to if one wishes an answer for a magical question. **Only for alenti.** 

In the Empire the mage has studied in the Academy, either a simple finder of apeiron or with higher interests, in the Free Lands they are a caster taught by the Society of Casters, working also either as a finder of apeiron or studying their own theories.

#### Priest

The priest has sworn their life to a god and has received a part of the god’s power in response. The power of their spells comes directly from their god and they must follow the principles of their god to retain access to that power. The priest is an example to others and fights for what is important to them. A priest can be recognised by their holy symbol and robe. A priest may bless or curse, depending on whether someone has earned the attention of their god. 

Each god has a different power, there are eight to choose from on both sides, either in the Empire or in the Free Lands. Every god gives some sort of advantage in choosing other skills. **Only for alenti** (who are not lagars, moroia or wulvers. A priest may never become one of them either). 

**In the Empire** 

Malakhim - order and law 
Keteos - death
Atrepe - knowledge
Parendi - time and movement 
Terhent - war
Sulenis - creation 
Baruna - cities and music
Darsilis - life 

**In the Free Lands**  

Ban-Mawr - chaos and oaths 
Lir-Neth - death and visions 
Vael-Ser - tricks and shadows
Arim-Wol - bounty and music
Nal-Mat - hunt and rage
Rhen-Apa - forests and ancestors
Zer-Nim - destruction and illnesses
Eil-Gann - life and movement

#### Rogue

The rogue is not always but often on the other side of the law, operating in the shadows. The rogue moves silently and enters places without keys. They are also skilful at finding and disarming traps. **Available for alenti and theumites.** 

In the Empire a rogue may be a bounty hunter or a thief, relieving people of their property and fencing them off on the black market. In the Free Lands a rogue may be a scout or a shadow walker fulfilling the orders of their leader. There are theumites with these skills as well, who prefer to benefit alone from their skills.

#### Sorcerer

A sorcerer is a powerful theumite, dedicated to using their element in various ways. The sorcerer has a choice of different spells, and spells unique to their element. A more powerful sorcerer may replenish themselves by consuming apeiron and may also create new spells. **Only for theumites.** 

There are many kinds of sorcerers, usually they are stubborn and curious, and talented from a young age. While other theumites prefer to use their skills while living in the source in a more peaceful manner, the sorcerers travel the outer world and study what interests them. A sorcerer is a frightening opponent on the battlefield, especially when they have learned to turn their spells against others.  

#### Warrior

A warrior is a good fighter who knows many ways to defeat their opponents. They either know how to use many weapons or are dedicated to a single weapon with which they can dominate the battlefield. The warrior is often endurant and strong, having learned many skills during their years of fighting. Some warriors fight unarmed. **Available for alenti and theumites.** 

In the Empire a warrior may be a soldier who has long served in a legion, or a city guard. In the Free Lands a warrior is usually in the retinue of a clan or tribe chief, dedicated to protecting them and fighting the Empire in their name. Many of them are members of fighting societies, always learning more. 

As the war is over, there are many veterans in the Empire and many thrill-seeking fighters in the Free Lands, who often become caravan guards or mercenaries. Amongst the theumites warriors are a bit more rare as each one of them is precious and not easily let to the battlefields. However, theumites traveling the outside world also learn to use weapons as they cannot always rely on their element.

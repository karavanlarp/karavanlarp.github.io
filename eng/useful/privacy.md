Participants’ personal information gathered through forms or e-mail can be accessed only by the Caravan team. The information is not used for business purposes or distributed to third parties. 

### Mailing list

The Caravan mailing list includes game participants. If you have participated in one of our games, we will send you information about future games. Information about registration, payments, role creation and other necessities is sent only to participants of a given event. If you do not wish to receive any further updates about events, please send an e-mail to [karavanlarp@gmail.com](mailto:karavanlarp@gmail.com).

### Forms

We use registration forms to gather various data about players, such as their name, age, phone number and e-mail address. We ask about possible food allergies and other health problems. The information in the forms is accessible only to the organizers. In case the event uses a catering service or the catering is handled by a third party, they will be provided with an anonymous list of food allergies and dietary requirements.

Should you wish for your information, gathered through forms or otherwise, to be deleted, send an e-mail to [karavanlarp@gmail.com](mailto:karavanlarp@gmail.com).
We use the players’ information solely for organizing the event and providing a better play experience.

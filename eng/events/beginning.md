### Caravan I: Beginning

_The port town of Aren is always full of people. It is easy to get lost in here and even easier to lose your wallet._

_It is early autumn, the evenings are still warm._

_Were you taking a proper caravan, you would need to go to the travel office during the day to buy yourself a place. Caravans are popular, even when you will be traveling in winter when you go with them._ 

_You have a different target. To join the secret caravan you must first find the Beautiful Moon taverna. In the middle of all this noise it is hard to find, seems to be a place hidden well. Finally you find a worn green door on a side alley and pull it open._ 

_The night is filled with lively music and warm air, the taverna is full despite being off the main streets._ 

_You enter to the following sight: barkeeps working behind the counter, nearly every seat taken. A shiny full moon hangs from the ceiling. The source of the music is a trio of bards who charming all they can out of their instruments. Here and there you can notice a few card games, and in a darker corner two suspicious people are exchanging money and something else that is quietly tucked into a jacket._ 

_Are there others here who wish to join the caravan? When you watch the crowd, there does not seem to be anyone else who looks like a caravan traveler. You make your way to the counter and order an “Autumn Yellow” after waiting, just like written in the directions._ 

_The drink is small, yellow and very bitter. From under the glass you find a folded paper._ 

Looking for the caravan?

You will find it tomorrow in Eres Forest. 

Happy searching!

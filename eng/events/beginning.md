## Caravan I: Beginning

_The port town of Aren is always full of people. It is easy to get lost in here and even easier to lose your wallet._

_It is early autumn, the evenings are still warm._

_Were you taking a proper caravan, you would need to go to the travel office during the day to buy yourself a place. Caravans are popular, even when you will be traveling in winter when you go with them._ 

_You have a different target. To join the secret caravan you must first find the Beautiful Moon taverna. In the middle of all this noise it is hard to find, seems to be a place hidden well. Finally you find a worn green door on a side alley and pull it open._ 

_The night is filled with lively music and warm air, the taverna is full despite being off the main streets._ 

_You enter to the following sight: barkeeps working behind the counter, nearly every seat taken. A shiny full moon hangs from the ceiling. The source of the music is a trio of bards who charming all they can out of their instruments. Here and there you can notice a few card games, and in a darker corner two suspicious people are exchanging money and something else that is quietly tucked into a jacket._ 

_Are there others here who wish to join the caravan? When you watch the crowd, there does not seem to be anyone else who looks like a caravan traveler. You make your way to the counter and order an “Autumn Yellow” after waiting, just like written in the directions._ 

_The drink is small, yellow and very bitter. From under the glass you find a folded paper._ 

Looking for the caravan?

You will find it tomorrow in Eres Forest. 

Happy searching!

<h3 id="description">What happened?</h3>

_Strange things happened on a nice summer day. Those who wished to join the Caravan had to fight bandits and find rarely walked paths. At the meeting place they found a woman who kept a little tavern, but nobody from the Caravan itself._

_The next arrivals were Imperial border agents who gave out border passes and performed medical tests, as there were rumors of a plague outbreak nearby. Freelanders came as well. A group from somewhat far away was searching for their relative, whose fate became clear soon enough - she and the theumites she had been leading had died gruesomely. The adventurers found only their remains and a closing portal._

_Finally the Caravan’s representative arrived, and everybody got busy filling out forms and signing papers to join up as that was why they had come. Meanwhile they also searched the forest - full of plants and other things, and had a battle or two._

_As the evening fell, mysterious shades troubled the group. They were hard to defeat. At least the leader of the Caravan’ and her companion made it out of the forest after many struggles. The last surprise of the evening was that the tavern keeper had been possessed by another shade, which the adventurers readily killed._

_The new arrivals were led to the Caravan in the dark of the night and set up in their chosen wagons. The journey north continued in the morning..._

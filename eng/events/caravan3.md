## Caravan III: Eve of Endings

_After a long journey through the deep and shadowy woods, the caravan emerges once again into sunshine. Shrubberies and small groves intertwine with rolling meadows dressed in autumn gold. The wagons often pass by fields busy with lively harvest. As the caravan thunders past, local farmers stretch their backs for a moment and look on, curious. At night, the lights of the caravan are echoed by small embers here and there: the homes of the hardy settlers of the Borderlands, comforting and cozy shelters in the darkened landscape._

_Several months have passed since the caravan left the shrine of Terhent. The citadel in Raghel draws near and Empire legionaries are seen patrolling the roads. The caravan stops briefly in village taverns where the crowd is often divided in two: freelanders sit on one side, leontite natives on the other. Sometimes those inns turn into friendly cultural melting pots, other times the air is thick with tension and mistrust._

_But before reaching the fortress of Raghel, an important Free Lands holiday awaits - the Eve of Endings, devoted to Zer-Nim the Doombringer. Anera, the caravan’s guide, has heard of a local village that hosts festivities and a solemn rite in honor of Zer-Nim. People gather from near and far to the village right on the path of our travellers - the caravan decides to stop by and leave all bad things behind on the Eve of Endings, in order to carry on with clean hearts and good fortune. Besides, this is a good opportunity to witness the customs and traditions of the Free Lands and enjoy the merriment of the party, to boot!_

### What?

The third game in the Caravan LARP series: Eve of Endings. The caravan has reached a freelander village that is hosting a great celebration in honor of the doom god Zer-Nim: the Eve of Endings. Travellers may use this opportunity to taste some good brews in the village tavern, venture onto the dance grounds, talk and trade with villagers and participate in the customs of the Free Lands. Naturally, the adventurers might also encounter the darker side of village society, such as mystical secrets or more earthly intrigue.

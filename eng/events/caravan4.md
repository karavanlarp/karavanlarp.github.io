## Caravan IV: The Wedding Hunt of the Chosen

_The wheels of the Caravan always keep going. The traveling party has passed the town of Korilos and the north end of the Sky Mountains. Here and there they have met various adventurers, who are looking into the mysteries in the mountains. Some of them can be met again at the inn, but others do not return. Both travelers and locals keep going missing, and thus noone wishes to travel alone._ 

_Rumors of plague come from the Empire, but it has not caught up to the caravan yet. Those from the Free Lands talk of ravaged forests and howling woods. The rare theumite travelers are terse and seem to be looking for something or someone._

_The next stop of the Caravan is a small copse, where rumors say a dazzling circus troupe can be found - both the workers and travelers could see the entertainments and divert their thoughts. Is it either coincidence or fate, but by the words of the Caravan's guide Anja, a theumite hermit is also living nearby. They could have answers about the artifacts acquired by the travelers and the fate of the still missing theumite Zalmana._ 

_Noone yet knows that at the same time with the caravan,  a pair of Chosen has arrived with their retinue. What might they be looking for on the borderlands?_

## Caravan V - Merriment in Time of Plague

_The Caravan has moved on after meeting the traveling Chosen and the circus troupe. The weather is bad and the road conditions are worse, forcing the Caravan to travel slowly and carefully. Rumors abound of plague, strangely behaving moroia and even more uncommon dangers._

_On the way to the Hekaton Fields is the hamlet of Serma. The Caravan arrives in time for their monthly fair. It brings all sorts of people to the settlement to trade, gossip and meet new faces. All of these visitors meet the Caravan’s travelers in the tavern of Saint Vitellus, named for the local saint._

### What?

The fifth game of the Caravan larp series: Merriment in Time of Plague. At the current stop of the Caravan the travelers can meet various colorful characters, participate in the fair celebrations and enjoy a nice rest at the tavern before getting on the road again. 

### When?

May 3rd, 2025. The game takes place on Saturday, from early afternoon to late evening. We will announce the more exact times during April. 

### Where?

[Tavern of the Headless Chicken](https://www.theorderofblacknumenoreans.com/tavern), Tallinn.

NB! The tavern itself does not have a toilet. The closest toilet we can use is about 200 meters away in another building. 

### Registration

Registration is confirmed upon ticket payment. The maximum number of players is 40, the game takes place with a minimum of 25 participants.

Registration ends on April 14th. 
[Registration is open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9XD5jYHPZp5Ph_twvLRRucKN7935Jqq4SE1FNfovwRQafkA/viewform?usp=dialog)

We ask returning players who want to use their CPs to register and fill out their character forms by April 5th so the organisers have enough time to give proper attention to your characters. You can also register after April 5th but then we cannot promise to take everything into account.

### Tickets

* PC - 50 €
* NPC - 30 €
* Sponsor - 70+ € - If you register before April 1st you can support a fellow player with a cheaper ticket or support the larp (cooler props) 
* Sponsored PC - 30 €

We ask you to pay the ticket price as soon as you receive payment information, as only a successful payment guarantees a spot at the game. If you cannot transfer all of the ticket price at once, it is possible to pay in several installments. Please contact the game masters for further information.

Family tickets are available! If you wish to attend with children younger than 14, please write to karavanlarp@gmail.com. (Please note that we do not currently organise specifically child-friendly plots at the larp.)

If you wish to apply for a cheaper ticket, you must register by April 1st. After that date, sponsored tickets are assigned to applicants via lottery.

__Payment deadline is April 14th.__

### What will you get?

For the ticket price you get:
* Larp at an atmospheric tavern
* One hot meal, snacks and various cold/hot/alcoholic drinks from the barman
* Awesome NPCs
* Cool props

Although the series tells the tale of a caravan, the LARP includes as much or as little walking as you wish. The caravan travels between the games. (As the game takes place in the middle of Tallinn’s Old Town, there will be very little walking.)

### Food and alcohol

We offer one hot meal during the event - a thematic stew. There will be snacks available. The ticket price also includes drinks of your choice from the bar. 

Unlike in earlier Caravan games, this time we allow adult participants to drink alcoholic drinks served at the bar. The limit for every player is two alcoholic drinks and we ask you to drink mindfully. Every player is responsible for their behaviour and knowing their limits; players who make others uncomfortable due to inebriation will be asked to leave.

Bringing your own alcohol is not permitted!

### Languages
We expect foreign players to participate, so the game uses both Estonian and English. If no visitors are present, we will play in Estonian.

### Participants
All interested players are welcome, big or small. Participants younger than 14 are allowed only when accompanied by an adult. Underage participants who are older than 14 and come alone must provide a permission form filled by a parent, either before the event or on location before game start.

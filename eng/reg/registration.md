### Registration

[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rWLcxs9qTWRxCqIBn1W24DC5QsLv7UEQy56FUxnnlco) you can pre-register for the game. 

[Here](Karavan I: Alguse link) is more information about the upcoming event. 

We will send you payment information and once you we have received your payment, you have registered for the event. Please keep in mind we will not be able to return your payment after the payment deadline. 

Then we will send you the character and information forms. The first is for character creation and the second for various information we need from you. 

The world category has all the information you need to create your character, but if you are pressed for time it is also possible to read just the introduction and to select a premade character. 
 
When we have received the filled character form, we will create a character file for you which includes their basic information, skills and all other additional information you might need in the game. You can add to that file as well if you need to. 

For NPCs the process is a bit different, after receiving your payment we will send you information about the NPC roles available.

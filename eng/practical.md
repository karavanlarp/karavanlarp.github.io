### Practical

The first event of the Caravan larp series “The Beginning” will take place on August 26th near Türi, Estonia. The event will last all of Saturday, so you may arrive on Friday evening as well.

It is an adventure larp. Everyone is welcome, beginners as well. Those over 14 are welcome to attend with their parents’ permission. Younger players are welcome with an adult companion. The larp is meant for about 20-30 players.

The caravan itself moves during the time between events, so there will not be long-distance traveling during the larp.

We welcome players from everywhere, and therefore all information will be provided in both Estonian and English. We will adapt the languages using during the larp according to how many non-Estonian speaking players attend.

The price for players is 25 euros. For NPCs, it is 10 euros and for monstering NPCs, it is 5 euros. If you want to sponsor someone for a discount, you may add 10 euros to your payment. You can pay in multiple parts if you need to, please contact the gamemasters for additional information.

For the price you can sleep in the house (you will need to bring your own sleeping bag and mat), one hot meal on Saturday, also assorted snacks and drinks during the game. We will take your dietary requirements and allergies into account. You are also welcome to bring your own tent and camp if you wish. After the game you can use the sauna. 

The whole event is alcohol-free. Please do not bring any with you. 

The town of Türi nearby is easily reached from Tallinn by public transport (either bus or train). Transport to the location will be organised upon request.

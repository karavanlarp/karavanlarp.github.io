## Appendix 2: Mage 

### Waves

The mage’s spells can have many different wavelengths and thus it is important to use the spell with the correct wave to cancel another spell. A spell can have more than one wavelength and to break such a spell all the wavelengths need to be broken. 

#### Metamagical effects:

**Alpha wave**

The mage adds a wavelength to the spell: alpha.

**Beta wave**

The mage adds a wavelength to the spell: beta.

**Gamma wave**

The mage adds a wavelength to the spell: gamma.

**Delta wave**

The mage adds a wavelength to the spell: delta.

**Epsilon wave**

The mage adds a wavelength to the spell: epsilon.

**Lengthen spell**

The duration of the spell doubles. 

**Hard to cancel** {Mage level 3}

Twice the apeiron must be used to cancel the particular spell. 

Adding one metamagical effect uses one apeiron. The mage can choose whether to add a metamagical effect to their spells or not.

### Overuse: 

If the mage uses more apeiron in a day that they can handle, they will experience the symptoms of overuse. These symptoms cannot be healed magically and any magic use near the character witll cause them more pain. Symptoms also affect the alenti subraces. Overuse is cumulative (if a character casts a 2 apeiron spell over their limit, they will experience the third symptom. If the character casts a 3 apeiron spell right after that, they will experience the fifth symptom immediately.)

* Over 0 - The shakes for an hour after casting.
* Over 1 - Bleeding from eyes and mouth. 
* Over 2 - Character loses one lifepoint and feels weak. 
* Over 3 - Muscle pains all over the body, the character cannot run.
* Over 4 - The character cannot cast any spell during the rest of the game. 
* Over 5 - The character dies in horrible pain inside the hour.

## Character rules: Introduction

### How to use this document? 

The rules are in three parts. 

The first - general rules is required reading for everyone. We will go over the battle rules, conditions and other important things during the briefing before the game. The following list explains specific terms used in the rules. The second part includes character creation rules and class descriptions. You need to read the character creation part and the classes to make your choice. Third are the appendices - with recipes, spells and other additional information. Everything to do with your character - their traits, skills and so forth will be compiled onto a character sheet once you have filled out the character form. 

The rules are new. If you find contradictions or something confusing, write to us. Some of it is fairly experimental, but we can only see if it works by testing it. If we have to change something, we will do our best to make changes fair to the players. 

We have presented the skills for the first three character levels, the fourth and fifth character levels will be uploaded before the following games. In the upcoming game, all characters will be at level one, so it is best to check out the level one skills.

*Important rules about the game.*

**Declaring**

If someone declares an effect in Estonian and you cannot understand, it is all right to ask for it to be repeated in English. 

**Life points**

Life points symbolise the character’s health. A character’s life points never fall below zero. Losing life points changes character base condition (_Healthy_ -> _Tired_ -> _Exhausted_ -> _Dying_), more on that in the conditions section. 

**Healing**

Healing has two phases. At first skills like Medicine can be used to improve the character’s base condition. After that life points start to replenish with the correct skill used. 

**Killing**

A character can be killed when they have the condition _Dying_. 

**Weapon hits**

A strike is counted as a weapon hit if it meets one of the two following criteria:

* The swing preceding the hit was at least 1 meters.
* The person hit felt it or heard the noise of it

Any slight or glancing strikes are not counted. A weapon hit lowers a character’s life point, or a an armor point if they are wearing armor. 

A weapon hit always counts as 1 if not said otherwise. This is also the case if a character with a stronger attack does not declare their attack power. 

A character without skills in weapon use can use a one handed weapon in battle, but will become _Tired_ after combat (even if none of their hits actually hit their opponent or vice versa). A character may only have a weapon at the start of the game if they have the skill for it. Knives are the only exception and can be owned by all characters.

**Wounds**

A character is wounded exactly how they were hit. If a blunt weapon was used, the result is inner damage or even a broken bone. In the case of a sharp weapon, the character receives a bleeding wound. When using the Medicine skill, the wounds have to be dealt with accordingly. 

A wounded character can be healed by someone else or by themselves, as long as they have the skill for it, either Medicine or healing spells. 

Important! *Combat must be as safe as possible!*

1. Injuring another player on purpose, too brutal fighting, hitting the head and groin areas is forbidden.
2. Physical contact in battle is forbidden. Wrestling can be played if both players agree to it, but not in the middle of the battle. Bashing with any sort of shield is also not allowed.  
3. All weapons must be checked before being used. The check will be made according to the common safety norms. We will check arrows and bows extremely carefully. Using unchecked weapons is forbidden. 

**Armor**

A character with the skill can have armor points. The gamemaster will award armor points to the character according to their skills and the appearance of the armor. Appearance is more important than actual defensive benefit, more points are awarded for realistic and nice looking armor. Armor points are lost before life points. If an armor’s points have fallen to zero, it is broken and must be repaired with the skill Smithing I. If only some of the armor’s points are lost in the battle, the armor points will be full for the next battle. 

Ranged weapons (arrows) ignore non-magical armor points. They wound the character, but do not lower armor points. 

* Small shield - to 50x50 cm
* Large shield - over 50x50 cm

**Weapon types**

* Knives - to 60 cm
* One-handed weapons - to 120 cm
* Two-handed weapons - over 120cm
* Ranged weapons - bows, crossbows (max. strength 12 kg)
* Throwing weapons - under 30cm (with the exception of javelins)

**Special battle effects**

Mana pouches - Being hit with a mana pouch causes the requisite effect. Hits against armor and shields also count. The damage dealt with a mana pouch ignores armor. 

**Magic**

Casters participating in the game will receive a certain amount of light spheres to use. Light spheres are used to mark casting and spells with a longer duration. It symbolises the magical visible energy around the caster or the target. Light spheres can also be found in the game with colored ribbons, in which case they mark a magical effect nearby. The light spheres themselves are outgame props and cannot be looted. If a player receives a sphere to use, to mark magical armor for example, they must turn it off once the effect ends and return it to the player who gave it to them or to a GM. Not all spells need to be marked, the spells that require a light sphere are marked separately with a (P) after their name. 

There are six colors. 

All of these can represent different sources of magic. They can be learned if someone used a spell to identify the spell or does any other similar action. So: if a player sees another player holding a green light sphere, they will understand ingame that the other character is affected by a spell. Magic-user (Mage, Priest, Sorcerer) classes can ask the source of the magic (apeiron magic, divine magic or theumite magic). For more information they must cast a spell. 

* White - Air, Atrepe, Lir-Neth, Eil-Gann
* Yellow - Light, Malakhim, Arim-Wol 
* Red - Red, Terhent, Baruna, Zer-Nim 
* Blue - Water, Parendi, Ban-Mawr, Nal-Mat, apeiron 
* Green - Earth, Sulenis, Darsilis, Rhen-Apa 
* Purple - Shadow, Keteos, Vael-Ser

**Exception:** If we need to mark a possibly dangerous spot in the dark, we will do it with a combination of red and white spheres. Ingame it means nothing, outgame it means you need to move carefully when near them. If there is any such marking in the game, we will inform you at the briefing. 

**Casting**

There are three magic-using classes in the game: Mage, Priest and Sorcerer. 

To cast, the magic user must roleplay ingame, and then say the spell’s outgame name and effect. Depending on the spell and target, explaining it can be needed. If the spell has to be marked with a light sphere, the sphere must be either fastened in a visible place or given to the target of the spell. 

Explaining is simple when the target is close. If you want to cast at someone farther away, getting the player’s attention first is recommended before actually casting. When casting at a larger group, it is best to announce the spell with a clear loud voice so the people around you will hear you.

If you hear a spell called out in battle, pay attention to the caster.

If the caster says the outgame name of the spell, the spell will be resolved and cannot be stopped. 

**How does casting look like?**

* **Mage** - The mage concentrates on their chosen spell and says the triggering power word. Needed: the spell disk of the spell in question and enough apeiron. The mage must also be able to speak, even in just a whisper. 
* **Priest** - The priest calls their god by their name or chosen title and tells them their wish. Needed: contact with their holy symbol. The priest must also be able to speak, even in just a whisper.
* **Sorcerer** - The sorcerer focuses on their element with different hand gestures.

Light spheres can be used to mark casting. A fire sorcerer casting a fireball may turn on their red light when focusing on their element. When the spell resolves the light can be turned off. The player can use their own light if they wish, read the Equipment Appendix for more.

**Spell types**
There are several types of spells. 

* Area spell - The spell affects an area and those inside it. 
* Self spell - The spell affects the caster.
* Pointing spell - The spell affects the target pointed at by the caster. The target must be able to hear the spell.
* Touch spell - The spell affects another character, an item or a place. The caster may also use touch spells on themselves.
* Throw spell - The target must be hit by a mana pouch for the spell to resolve. 

**Spell characteristics**

* Duration - How long the spell lasts. Some spells only come into effect after their duration has ended. 
* Description - Description of what the spell does. 
* Cost - The cost of the spell in apeiron, prayers or mana.
* Name - OG name of the spell, must be declared after casting the spell IG. 

**Special strikes**

Special strikes also work when used on armor or shields. The strike does not have to lower life points to resolve. 
* **“Two”** - The hit counts as two weapon hits. 
* **“Three”** - The hit counts as three weapon hits.
* **“Stun”** - The hit causes the condition Stunned.
* **“Break shield”** - The hit breaks the shield. All hits into a broken shield count as hits on the character themselves. 
* **“Break armor”**- The hit destroys all of the characers’ armor points. 

**Traps**

There are both nonmagical and magical traps in the game. Regular traps are marked by outgame mousetraps. The character receives 2 damage when they hear the triggering of the mouse trap. Traps ignore armor. Traps can only be removed by a character with the Disarm Trap skill. 

**Restraining**

A character who is not struggling can be restrained by a character with the skill. It is marked by a length of rope held around the wrists by the restrained character. There will be no outgame restraining of anyone. Being restrained gives the character the condition Pinned. 

**Drinking brews**

A character must drink a brew of their own free will, unless they are _Unconscious_ or _Pinned_. The brew does not have to be ingested outgame (Brews given by the gamemasters will usually be water with food coloring), it is enough to pour out the dose. 

**Hand to hand combat**

To start hand to hand combat the player must inform the other player who can respond with picking up a weapon. 

The combatants play rock-paper-scissors until one of them wins. The fight is roleplayed after that. The losing character becomes Unconscious. If a third person intervenes, the fight is ended immediately.

<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>

*There are four base conditions. They are from a scale from best to worst: Healthy, Tired, Exhausted, Dying.*

**Healthy** - The character is healthy and can use all their skills if the other conditions are met.  

**Tired** - The character cannot use skills that need concentration. (Marked with the symbol “€” in the rules). If the character loses a lifepoint, they become Tired. *The Tired condition is healed after 30 minutes of rest.*

**Exhausted** - The character is in bad physical and mental shape. They cannot use skills that need concentration, (€), fight, run or do any other physically challenging actions. If the character loses all their lifepoints, they become Exhausted. If the Exhausted character is hit or loses another lifepoint due to an effect, they become Dying. Restoring lifepoints does not cure the Exhausted condition. *The Exhausted Condition is ended by the skill Medicine or alchemical/magical healing, and it does not end by itself (except with the trait Regeneration).*

**Dying** - The character’s condition is critical. They cannot fight or use their skills. They must lie down and can move very slowly or crawl. They cannot speak in full sentences, but can slowly use some words. The character will die if not given first aid after 15 minutes. *The Dying Condition is ended by the skill Medicine or alchemical/magical healing.*

**Unconscious** - The character is unconscious for 2 minutes and must close their eyes and ignore everything around them. The player counts to 120 slowly after which the condition ends.

**Stunned** - The character may not move or speak for 3 seconds. 

**Pinned** - The character is tied up and/or magically restrained. They may not move their limbs. The duration of this condition depends on the effect that caused it. The condition is marked by a piece of rope or ribbon held around the hands, there will be no outgame tying up. *The Pinned condition is ended by the skill Skilful Escape or if someone else frees the character/dispels the spell.*

**Poisoned** - The character is poisoned, poisons have various effects (listed in the poisons appendix). *The Poisoned condition is ended by a curing potion or the appropriate healing spell.*

**Sick** - The character is sick, sicknesses have various effects (listed in the illnesses appendix). *The Sick condition is ended by healing the character.*

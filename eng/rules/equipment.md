## Appendix 5: Equipment

*This appendix describes starter equipment for different classes and tools needed to use various skills.* 

There are no direct restrictions on bringing equipment into the game, but we may choose not to allow some of it into the game. 

**Weapons and shields** - For more exact requirements please see the rules appendix of Nordic Equinox [here](http://www.ancalagon.ee/index.php/en/essentials/game-rules).

**Mana pouch** - Must be made of a light and soft material, which is safe to throw. You can use various grains for filling, like lentils, barley, peas. The mana pouch should be about 5x5cm large and weigh under 150 grams. 

### Alchemist

**Alchemist’s Book** - (Required) The book has recipes, the essences reaction table and other information.

**Gloves** - It is good to wear gloves while gathering and processing components to be protected from possible contamination

**Knife or sickle** - (Required) Needed to gather components. 

**Bottles** - If the alchemist wishes to prepare brews to be ingested later in the game, they need to pour it into a bottle or another container that can be closed. 

**Additional equipment** - Different containers and boxes can be used to contain components. Various mixing equipment can also be used during brewing potions. 


### Expert

**Profession** - The character may bring whichever equipment they need for their profession.

**Shell repair** - A small hammer is needed for repairs, as are different pieces of metal. The latter will be supplies by the GMs.

**Medicine** - At the very least, bandages are needed for healing. A character with a higher medical skill is also welcome to use various surgical equipment and so forth. 

**Teas** - Any drinkable loose tea can be used. The container should be marked with the contents so other characters with the skill also know what it is for. 

**Smithing** - A hammer and other repairing tools are necessary.

**Binding** - A rope is needed, with enough length so that the bound character can keep it around their hands. A chain can also be used. 

**Gathering** - Any cutting implement works.

### Rogue

**Lockpicks** - (Required: Locksmith) Implements to pick locks with. 

**Poison** - (Required: Poisoner) Will be given by the GMs.

**Torture equipment** - (Required: Torture) Equipment to torture a character with. 

### Mage 

**Apeiron - Will be given by the GMs.**

**Mage’s Book** - (Required) The mage’s symbol must be on the cover. The book holds spells the mage can cast, their symbols and words of power. (Symbols and words are given to the mage at character creation since they are culturally different.) 

**Spell discs** - (Required) A disc must have a minimum diameter of 10 cms. A ready made spell disc must have the mage’s symbol and the symbol(s) of the spell. A blank disc must have the mage’s symbol. The material should be something that can be written on during the game if one needs to create new spells. Ideally the material should be something that cannot be folded but also not too heavy. The color may be anything but bright white. (Options: plastic, clay, plywood, wood) 

### Priest 

**Holy symbol** - (Required) The symbol must be about 15x15 cm and removable from the costume. The material is not so important but it should be strong enough not to be folded. Domain: skill - equipment is mandatory for a skill even if it has been acquired through the domain choice. 

### Sorcerer

**Elemental light** - A sorcerer can have a separate light source the color of their element that can be easily switched on and off, to symbolise spellcasting. If the player does not wish to bring their own light, the GMs will give a light sphere.

## Character rules: Character creation

Every player starts with 6 character points. 

All characters can read and write in their native language and the languages their players know outgame (Estonian and/or English) More exact language skills are marked on the character sheet. 

**Character restrictions**

We have some restrictions for PCs, because the presence of characters with a certain social status would influence the game far too much.

PCs cannot be: 
* The Chosen 
* Currently working Imperial officials or police 
* The Tribeless
* Lifelong outlaws (harboring one of those is illegal)
* Clan or tribe chiefs and elders

(PCs can be low-level officials or police: it is important they do not have power to affect the game entirely.)

For the rest of your wishes we recommend asking the GMs, we promise to look through your requests. 

We also have a limit on group size. The limit is five people. We have set this limit to avoid the dominance of a single player group in the game. A player group is made of characters who know each other before coming to the Caravan.

You are of course permitted to plan to play together with friends. 

<hr>

The first step of character creation is picking your character’s race. The regular alenti is the only character race that does not cost character points. 

After this you may acquire a character class and/or buy a level of Expert skills depending on how many CPs you have left. A character can only have one class. 

In addition to their class, each character may choose one level of Expert skills, paying the indicated cost. A character who chose Expert as their class may gain as many levels in those skills as they wish. However, a character with a different class may only ever have one level of Expert.

|Option                                  | Cost|
|----------------------------------------|-----|
|Level 1 class                           |4 CP |
|+1 level Expert (2 new skills)          |2 CP |
|Special race (all except regular alenti)|2 CP |
|Level 2 class                           |6 CP |
|Level 3 class                           |10 CP|

The choice of class and skills is made by filling out the character form. It is useful to think about the desired character before starting with the form.

Each character starts the game with 50 staurus or an equal amount of Free Lands currency. The character also starts with the equipment noted in their class description. Resources such as components and apeiron are provided by the GM. The equipment is generally the responsibility of the player, but the GM-s may be contacted for the loan of costuming elements. The list of equipment required to use skills can be found in [Appendix 5: Equipment](/eng/rules/equipment.html).

**Death:** A player’s Character Points do not expire upon the character’s death. The player may use them to create a new character for the next game. The new character cannot be closely related to the previous character and cannot use the previous character’s resources or contacts.

**How to gain Character Points?**

Character Points are awarded to both PC-s and NPC-s. Participation in a game guarantees a base level of points. Additional points may be earned through costuming, preparation and role play. NPC-s also gain Character Points for participation which they can use to create a PC in the future. Information gained as an NPC cannot be used when entering the game as a PC.

### Races

A description of races, their attributes and costs. Players will receive additional information about their race.

#### Alenti
* Cost: 0 CP
* Life points: 2

Class limitation - A normal alenti may not choose the sorcerer class. 

#### Lagar
* Cost: 2 CP
* Life points: 2

**Attributes:**

**Lagar’s Kiss** - The lagar may suck the blood of another character to regain life points. The target of the bloodsucking must volunteer or be _subdued_. Each minute of the kiss increases the lagar’s life points by one and decreases the target’s life points by one. The lagar may suck the blood of alenti, including Old Blood and wulvers. Theumites are not viable as they have no blood, moroia and lagars are not viable because their blood is not nutritious. 

**Poison Immunity** - The lagar is immune to poisons and may ignore their effects.

**Unnatural Endurance** - The lagar is never _tired_. A _Dying_ lagar may only be killed by decapitation or the piercing of the heart.

**Bloodthirst** - After the _exhausted_ condition ends, the lagar is famished and their fangs become visible (OG: the player puts fangs in their mouth). The lagar needs blood. They lose access to all skills requiring concentration (€) until they restore at least one life point through the Lagar’s Kiss. If the lagar is unable to use the Kiss for one subsequent hour, they become _exhausted_. The only way to remove this _exhausted_ state is through the Lagar’s Kiss. Fangs retreat after the bloodthirst has been sated. 

**Gift from the Afterlife (€)** - The lagar may restore to life one alenti who has not been dead over 15 minutes and who is not a priest or member of a subrace, by turning them into a lagar. After giving the Gift, the lagar loses one life point and the skill _Gift from the Afterlife_. The dead character is resurrected after 15 minutes as an _exhausted_ lagar with one life point. Each lagar has a special bond with the one they created.

Class limitation - A lagar may not choose the priest or sorcerer class.

#### Moroia
* Cost: 2 CP
* Life points: 2

**Attributes:**

**Undead Vigor** - The moroia’s life points cannot be restored normally. They are not affected by any normal healing effects. A moroia can be healed by using the alchemical brew _Skin Glue_ or the Death Priest’s prayer _Repair Moroia_.

**Undead Endurance** - The moroia is never _tired_ or _exhausted_. Upon reaching 0 life points, the moroia is _dying_. The moroia can be in this state until repaired or permanently destroyed (by burning or being cut to pieces and spread apart).

**Disease and Poison Immunity** - The moroia is immune to all poisons and diseases and ignores their effects.

**Disease Vector** - Although a moroia is immune to diseases, their body contracts them easily and transfers them to others.

Class limitation - A moroia may not choose the priest or sorcerer class.

The moroia starts each game with one dose of _Wound glue_.

#### The Old Blood
* Cost: 2 CP
* Life Points: 2

**Attributes:**

**Regeneration** - An _exhausted_ Old Blood may rest for 10 minutes to become _tired_ and restore one life point.

**Disease Immunity** - The Old Blood never get ill and may ignore all disease effects.

Ectothermy - The Old Blood feels cold more keenly. They feel more lethargic in cool places and during the night.

Cold-Blooded - The Old Blood’s brain is more similar to lizards than contemporary alenti. The may be socially awkward, exhibit less empathy etc.

Class limitation - An Old Blood may not choose the sorcerer class.

#### Wulver
* Cost: 2 CP 
* Life points: 2

**Attributes:**

**Animal Form** - The wulver has two forms: alenti and animal. Changing shape takes as long as the player needs to make costume changes (add claws, ears or a tail). Raging wulvers may lose the ability to change shape, staying in animal form forever.

**Gift of the Beast** - In Animal Form, the wulver has access to one of the following abilities:
* **Great Fortitude** - The wulver has one extra life point (disappears when in Alenti form)
* **Supernatural Strength** - To affect the wulver in unarmed combat, the character must have the _Supernatural Strength_ ability. In all other cases the Wulver ignores the effects of unarmed attacks. The Wulver cannot be subdued by non-magical means.
* **Supernatural Endurance** - The wulver is never tired.
* **Quick Reflexes** - The wulver gains one armor point that is automatically restored after every fight.

The Gift of the Beast may be purchased up to four times. The first one comes with the race, the rest have to be obtained later. Every Gift after the first costs 2 CP. Every obtained Gift increases the likelihood of being trapped in animal form forever. The Gift must be purchased prior to use (the wulver cannot choose it after changing shape).

**Disease and Poison Vulnerability** - All diseases and poisons affect the wulver at double speed.

**Uncontrollable Rage** - Each wulver in animal form has a trigger that drives them into a rage. An enraged wulver attacks the closest character and then tries to run away. If their escape is stopped, the wulver reacts aggressively. The trigger is determined by the GM-s at random, though players can give suggestions. 

Class limitations - A wulver may not choose the priest or sorcerer class.

#### Theumite
* Cost: 2 CP
* Life points: 2 

**Attributes:**

**Elemental Shell** - The theumite does not regain life points normally. They need the skill _Repair Shell_ or _Apeiron Cure_. The theumite chooses one of the following:
* **Strong Shell** - The theumite has one extra life point.
* **Regenerating Shell** - The theumite’s shell recovers at double speed when being repaired with apeiron or a suitable skill. When using _Apeiron Healing_, one unit of apeiron restores 2 life points. 
    
**Apeiron Healing** - The Theumite may regain life points by eating apeiron. Each unit of apeiron consumed restores 1 life point in 5 minutes. Apeiron can also improve the theumite’s condition, which improves by one level for each unit of apeiron consumed. (Overuse of apeiron may cause addiction)

**Apeiron Immunity** - The Theumite is immune to the effects of unrefined apeiron.

**Disease Immunity** - The Theumite never gets ill and ignores all disease effects.

**Elemental Magic (€)** - A Theumite who hasn’t chosen the sorcerer class can still cast one spell. They must choose it from the sorcerer elemental spell list and its element must match their own. The theumite has 1 mana point to use the spell.

Class limitation - A theumite may not choose the mage or priest class.

## Classes

*A description of classes and related skills.*

All classes consist of levels. After reaching a new level, the character automatically obtains all of its Core Module skills. In addition, a character may acquire Free Module skills according to the level description of the class (although some Free Module skills are only available to characters of specific origin - either the Free Lands, Empire or Theumite). Characters must always possess the lower level(s) of a skill to obtain the higher level version.

Before the game, characters gain knowledge related to their class.

### Alchemist

*The Alchemist knows how to use naturally occurring plants and other components to brew magical brews. The power of the brews doesn’t stem from the Alchemist but rather their knowledge and the correct use of ingredients. Some special components get their potency from the touch of the gods or the effects of contact with apeiron.*

#### Alchemical terms:
* **The Alchemist’s Book** - A book with alchemical information and the recipes known to the Alchemist.
* **Essence** - The alchemical type of a component. Determines the reaction between two components.
* **Component** - A resource used for brews. Can be plant- or animal-based.

The Alchemist can learn new recipes by studying the book of another. To learn a new recipe, the Alchemist must have a double quantity of the necessary components. All components are used for the learning process and the alchemist does not produce a potion. A first level potion takes 20 minutes to learn independently and 10 minutes with the help of an Alchemist who knows the recipe. (OG: the Alchemist writes the recipe in their book and goes through the preparation process)

**Brewing (€)**

The Alchemist can prepare brews, provided that they have the necessary recipe in their book. To prepare a brew, the Alchemist must expend the components listed in the recipe. The effects of potions prepared during the game last until the end of the game (see [Appendix 1: Alchemist](/eng/rules/alchemist.html)). The preparation of a brew takes 3 minutes per component.

**Leonte Fire {Alchemist Level 2}**<br />
Flameling + Mottled Firegrass<br />

Free Lands:<br />
**Minor Mutagen {Alchemist Level 2}**

When ingesting a brew, the Alchemist can choose to make it last two times more or two times less. This does not affect instantaneous brews. To gain this option, the Alchemist has ingested a special mixture of a rare mutagen and their own blood.

### Expert

*There are different kinds of Experts. Many of their skills are of no use in battle, but an Expert is the most free in developing their character and a good support to other classes. Lower level Expert skills are also accessible to other classes.*

Choosing the Expert as a main class at first level costs 4 CP and provides 4 simple skills, 2 simple skills and 1 complicated skill or 2 complicated skills.

In other cases, one level of Expert costs 2 CP and provides 2 simple skills or 1 complicated (¤¤) skill.

A player who chose Expert as their class can buy new levels as much as desired (paying 2 CP for each). Other classes may only obtain one level of Expert. This can be chosen upon character creation or later.

### Mage
*A mage is a person who can shape the world according to their will using the power of apeiron. In the Empire these people are called mages, in the Free Lands they are casters.*

Apeiromancy and runecraft are the two magic systems used by the alenti. Both rely on on magical signs and refined apeiron to fuel the spells. Every spell uses some amount of apeiron. The use of such spells does not require a natural talent for spellcasting.

This kind of casting is tiring. If a mage exceeds their daily limit, they may incur different injuries. In case of sufficient exertion the mage may become permanently crippled (see [Appendix 2: The Mage](/eng/rules/magician.html)).

There are some devices and machines that can perform different spell-like functions.

#### Magical terms:
* **Apeiron (refined)** - The fuel of apeiromancy and runecraft. It is enclosed in a specially sealed bottle. Apeiron is sold in different quantities, but usually in very tiny vials. These contain enough apeiron for one simple spell. More complicated spells may need more than one vial of apeiron. During the process of spellcasting, the apeiron energy will traverse the body of the caster and exit in the form of the spell.
* **Spell Discs** - The are two kinds of discs, marked and clean. A mage can use marked discs to instantly cast a spell. Clean discs are used to create new variations of the mage’s spells.
* **Mage Sign** - Every mage has their own sign, used on their spell discs and installed spells.
* **Mage Book** - The Mage Book contains spells, their words of power and variants a mage knows. The cover bears the mage’s sign.
* **Word of Power** - Uttering these words releases the spell’s power.

### Priest

*The priest is the servant of a god. They spread the god’s message in the world and stand for the god’s principles. The priest may use power granted by their god to bless or punish those around them.*

The magic of priests or divine magic is the second magic system of the alenti. Priestly magic requires faithful service to one particular god, which the god rewards by allowing the priest to channel their power. The channeling works through a holy symbol that the priest wears on their chest. The symbol is made from the power of the god and channeling the god’s power without it is dangerous to the priest.

Priests must observe the principles of their god. Denying them may lead to losing the connection with divine power for a while. Very deep conflict with divine principles may end in permanent severing of the priest-god bond.

The priest carries a holy symbol, a safe way to channel the god’s power. The symbol is the god’s power made manifest. It works when worn on the priest’s chest or in contact with their skin.

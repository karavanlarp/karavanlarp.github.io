It is the year 2851, the sixth year of peace.

The frontier is full of excitement, but dangerous. 

Even after the peace accord one can meet freelanders who care little for the signed treaty. The creatures of the forests and highlands think even less of it. A lone traveler can find their end quite easily here. But the risks are worth it - forgotten places and hidden treasures, undiscovered mysteries and closed doors await the brave adventurer. 

The Empire prefers having living citizens, and therefore the Merchantsâ€™ Guild profits greatly from the many caravans traversing the borderlands. Helpful guards, comfortable carriages, tireless steeds make travel easy. Traveling this way is pricey, however, and few can afford it. Besides, it is not much of an adventure if they do all the work for you!

This is not a story about a proper caravan. This is a story about a caravan hidden so well finding it is its own adventure. This is a story about a caravan with creaky wheels and drafty carriages, stale food and grumpy guards. But it is also the story of the caravan that goes to the most interesting places.

The caravan will accept anyone.

If you make it to the meeting point in time.
